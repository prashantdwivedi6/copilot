# Backend Documentation

This is the backend part of the Node.js and React.js application.

## Overview

The backend is built using Node.js and Express. It serves as the API for the application, handling requests from the frontend and interacting with the database.

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the backend directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Start the backend server using the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Directory Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the backend application.
  - **app.js**: Entry point of the application.
  - **controllers/**: Contains the logic for handling API requests.
  - **routes/**: Defines the API routes and associates them with controller methods.
  - **models/**: Contains data models for database interactions.

## API Endpoints

The backend exposes various API endpoints that can be accessed by the frontend. Refer to the routes defined in `src/routes/index.js` for more details.
